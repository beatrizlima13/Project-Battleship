//1. Create the game board:
 //  - Create a 2D array to represent the grid.
  // - Initialize all elements of the array to represent empty spaces.

//2. Place the ships:
   //- Randomly select positions on the grid to place the ships.
   //- Mark those positions as occupied.

//3. Start the game:
 //  - Display an empty grid to the player.
  // - Prompt the player to enter coordinates to guess the ship's location.

//4. Player's turn:
  // - Accept input from the player for the coordinates.
 //  - Check if the coordinates hit or miss a ship.
  // - Update the grid accordingly to indicate the result.

//5. Computer's turn:
 //  - Generate random coordinates to guess the player's ships.
  // - Check if the coordinates hit or miss a ship.
  // - Update the grid accordingly to indicate the result.

//6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until all ships are sunk or a player wins.

//7. End the game:
   //- Display the final grid with all ships revealed.
  // - Declare the winner (player or computer).
